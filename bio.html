			Glen was adopted and grew up in Hong Kong. He is a bit of a recluse, so we don't know too much of his backstory, but it is rumored that he was a male model in a Tibetan village for many years.

			Patrick grew up in a remote village in Alaska. He was the youngest of his 17 siblings, so all of his hand-me-down pants were always very worn and tattered. Because of this, he made it his life mission to make sure everyone had a good pair of pants in life. He took it a little too far when he decided to wrestle a bear into some skinny jeans... But to be fair, the bear looked great in those jeans!
